Subject: URGENT: Missing Security Headers Causing Game Disconnections

Hi Spribe Support Team,

We're experiencing critical issues with our Spribe integration where users are getting "kicked" from games immediately after placing bets. After extensive debugging, we've identified the root cause:

**ISSUE: Missing Security Headers in Callback Requests**

Our system expects these security headers for ALL callback requests:
- X-Spribe-Client-ID: reddybook75new
- X-Spribe-Client-TS: [timestamp]
- X-Spribe-Client-Signature: [signature]

**EVIDENCE FROM OUR LOGS:**

1. **AUTH requests work** (we temporarily bypassed signature validation):
```
[SPRIBE][AUTH][SUCCESS] {
  code: 200,
  message: 'Success',
  data: {
    user_id: '202043',
    username: 'ADMIN',
    balance: 2932830,
    currency: 'INR'
  }
}
```

2. **WITHDRAW requests FAIL** (missing headers):
```
[SPRIBE][SIGNATURE][DEBUG] {
  clientId: undefined,
  timestamp: undefined,
  signature: undefined,
  url: '/api/v1/callback/spribe/withdraw',
  method: 'POST'
}
[SPRIBE][SIGNATURE][ERROR] Missing required headers
```

**CURRENT HEADERS RECEIVED:**
```
host: 75club.games
x-real-ip: 194.36.47.150
x-forwarded-for: 194.36.47.150
remote-host: 194.36.47.150
connection: upgrade
content-length: 170
accept-charset: utf-8
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
accept: application/json; charset=utf-8
user-agent: UserAgent/Spribe
```

**MISSING HEADERS:**
- X-Spribe-Client-ID: reddybook75new
- X-Spribe-Client-TS: [timestamp]
- X-Spribe-Client-Signature: [signature]

**IMPACT:**
- Users can launch games ✅
- Users get "kicked" immediately after placing bets ❌
- This affects ALL games: plinko, mines, etc.

**OUR CONFIGURATION:**
- Callback URL: https://75club.games/api/v1/callback/spribe
- Operator Key: reddybook75new
- Secret Token: P8cs7H7swSnr1WwDRNQOBCPQjCLvkOlQ
- Supported Currencies: USD, INR

**REQUESTED ACTION:**
Please configure your callback system to include the required security headers for ALL callback types:
- /api/v1/callback/spribe/auth
- /api/v1/callback/spribe/withdraw (bets)
- /api/v1/callback/spribe/deposit (wins)
- /api/v1/callback/spribe (rollback)

**SIGNATURE GENERATION:**
String to sign: `${timestamp}${path}${body}`
Signature: HMAC SHA256 with secret token, hex encoded

This is blocking our production deployment. Please prioritize this fix.

Thank you,
